            I built this website with the help of my favorite engineer and
            accessibility advocate, <a
              href="https://tiagoromero.me"
              target="_blank"
              class="hover:text-violet-600 underline transition-all duration-150 ease-in-out"
              >Tiago Romero</a
            >. I believe all designers should strive to create products and
            experiences that can be used by the broadest range of people.
            Making accessible products creates a better experience for
            everyone. I do my best to apply the <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/"
              target="_blank"
              class="hover:text-violet-600 underline transition-all duration-150 ease-in-out"
              >WCAG 2.2 standards</a
            > and consider inclusivity in everything I do. If you find any
            accessibility problems, please reach out and I'll do my best to
            fix them quickly.

            I can't guarantee that all the externally linked content in my
            work is fully accessible, as I don't own it, but I choose to
            collaborate with folks who value inclusive design as much as I do.

          <p class="mt-2 outfit text-xl md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            Designing for accessibility is something I'm learning every day,
            and it warms my heart. I urge you to consider accessibility as
            part of your design process and inspire others to create a more
            inclusive world.
